Well @Tesco you advertise 24 hour opening at your stores but at 2am neither of my two local Tesco 24 hour extra stores is open!!! What’s the point
@Tesco why does the website say the Irvine Tesco is open 24hr when it actually opens at 5am? I need formula ASAP and now I need to wait?!
What's going on with the Christmas trees at @Tesco this year? Massive display of them at the entrance of local store. All in boxes that describe them as 6ft AND 180cm....which is it @tesco?! And who did the sums? An insecure bloke with an inferiority complex? #tradingstandards 🎄

"@Tesco absolutely appalled by Tesco Customer Service. Ordered two ‘free from’ caterpillar cakes for my friend’s 30th a week ago, waited in for delivery until 10.30pm today, only to be told they do not have stock. Extremely disappointed, no notice given, won’t be using Tesco again"
Well done @Tesco. 8-9 delivery slot still not arrived. Phoned customer service who were unable to get hold of driver or store...yet payment has been taken.
"@Tesco spoke to you today about deliver spots before Xmas, you told me midnight Friday they get released . Stayed up and surprise there are none available again.... Why do you lie ???"
@Tesco Absolutely disgusted with the lack of care and customer services. Shopping has not turned up and I've had to call several times chasing it. Customer for 15 years &amp; have been treated appallingly. #shambles #uncaring

"Ordering stuff from @Tesco online? BEWARE!! Authorised a payment of £34, went to collect @ click&amp;collect and they’d charged me £46! Apparently this is not a receipt &amp; additional payment had been taken without my authorisation. I’ve been refunded now but I will NEVER trust #tesco https://t.co/kUwpnRUTma"
@Tesco why do your self service tills give your 15p change in only coppers? #everytime Politely asked checkout person to change but refused
@Tesco 15 minutes already Jesus 😐 https://t.co/Pqq2FmyjVj
A guy with special needs in @Tesco asking the staff how much things are as he could see the labels... their response “look at the labels” clearly he couldn’t see them! I helped him out with the prices and his shopping Not sure their staff remember their motto Every Little helps!
"Eh, ok then @Tesco - we'll just do our weekly online shop elsewhere. https://t.co/vQ3CcWZ9am"
@Tesco How many customers do you lose per day by presenting them with this screen for 10 minutes before getting to your site? #shocker #infrastructure #scale https://t.co/IEhPnD91fp
"Seriously, @Tesco, you’ve put a queuing system in place blocking people from accessing your website? This is not how we dynamically scale :("
@Tesco so trying to check the status of an order on Tesco direct and can't get past your black friday landing page! Bout time retailers invested more in their IT if they are going to participate in these events! #10minswaiting #unacceptable

"No but I really don't why @Tesco @123088 stopped selling Mortadella and replaced it with Cooked Prosciutto, ham and cooked prosciutto are the SAME. Mortadella though? I really appreciated you for that. Please bring it back I heard ALL the Italians saying they'll stop coming!!"
@Tesco what is the point of 7 day Black Friday deals if you can’t access website. Page refreshes every 30secs which shoves me to back of queue each time. #annoying
"8.55am at Tesco Express in Green Lanes. If breakfast is not served now, then when? #disappointed #tesco @Tesco https://t.co/cRmznCDxts"
"@Tesco have you deleted the everyday value tissues? Not that I’m going out of my way to get them (!), but I couldn’t order them with my online shop, they’re not in my local Tesco, and out of stock at the one near my workplace?"
@Tesco seriously what is up with your website. Stuck in a Black Friday refresh screen all morning....off to shop elsewhere now
"@Tesco can you please explain why we keep getting mouldy fruit? This is happening way too much and is getting ridiculous! We order over £150 every week to our office and expect better produce. If it continues, we will have to do our shop elsewhere. https://t.co/Ew12kDQH87"
@Tesco I've been in your online queue trying to get to the F&amp;F baby section of your website for 30mins!! What's going on?!?!

"Um @sainsburys @Tesco etc why do you package stuff that perishes in 3 days, in non recyclable plastic that lasts a million years?"
@Tesco When are you bringing lists back? At the moment I have my Xmas shop in my basket which means I can’t do a weekly shop until I’ve booked my Christmas delivery slot.  It makes things harder!
"@678 @Tesco @UPSHelp Does this look like a card you’d issue to any of your staff? Found on floor and trying to return, obviously a bit difficult https://t.co/z0233QL77z"

@Tesco you guys ever heard of the words ‘server’ and ‘maintenance’ in the same sentence? Or ‘server’ and ‘improve’ in the same sentence? It’s 2017
@Tesco does your delivery saver include Groceries Click &amp; Collect? Thanks
"@Tesco your fake waiting room is ridiculous. I want to simply cancel an order I placed, yet I'm forced to ""queue"" with people wanting Black Friday deals. Access to our account should be kept separate; we shouldn't have to queue. It's an incredibly annoying feature. Get rid."
"@Tesco Hi my grocery delivery this morning got cancelled shortly before the delivery window, but the order online says it was delivered, is this normal?! I don't want to get billed for an order I didn't get!"

"I have to say, you cannot fault @Tesco for their customer service, every time I contact them no matter how small an issue they listen &amp; act"

"Hi @Tesco, my groceries are over 30 mins late and I need to go to work. Can you help?"
"@Tesco Are your Christmas turkeys halal? Just asking, since you seem to think that Muslims do Christmas!! If they are, I won't be buying one!"
@Tesco that’s my point ‘Dairy free alternative’ aren’t milk and should not be promoted as or with milk. They are nutritionally inferior. Please support dairy and support your #farmers? https://t.co/AmlFgjiajW
@Tesco hey guys. can you check or confirm that the Krispy Kreme offer from the KK fridge is still on. 3 classics for £3. the door sticker claims it is. the box barcodes don't. i got my box for £3 but only after I showed staff the sticker. they had no clue about the offer.
@Tesco Please don't change you're website again. Its been a nightmare re-teaching my 60 year old mum how to do her shopping! 😂😂
"The incompetence of @115830 and @AmazonHelp increases exponentially. Having had the items returned, INSTEAD of refunding me, they've only gone and made 'a replacement order'! This is after my son went to Tescos after Amazon's constant failure to supply the item we pre-ordered."

"@Tesco Hi, is there currently a problem ordering groceries online? I keep getting error messages."
@Tesco is your grocery website down? Can’t do my shopping!!
@Tesco how long will ur servers be down for? Trying to complete grocery shopping on mobile app. Thx.
👿 that annoying feeling when you have just spent ages doing your online food shop &amp; the website goes down ...... @Tesco #firstworldproblem
@Tesco don’t do this to me! Spent ages doing my shop &amp; at checkout I get this!! Can’t get my order back 😢 really don’t like the new website 👎 https://t.co/WdO60DjEDq
Ugh oh @Tesco just added £100 worth of groceries and your site falls over! Is there an ETA on a fix?
"So I keep getting little messages asking what I think of the new @Tesco website.  Well, it's better than the old one in a number of respects, except for one: the old one worked, and the new one doesn't.  Maybe spend less time making it look fancy and more time making it work."
@Tesco what is up with your website AGAIN?
"Hi @Tesco I forgot to use my £5 off when you £25 or more voucher when I did an online clothes shop order earlier, is there anything that can be done please?"
@Tesco very interested in your Eco Active range but can you confirm that the product &amp; it's ingredients have not been tested on animals #crueltyfree
"If you fancy getting your groceries at all

Then you need to look past @Tesco

#LooksLikeNeverIsBetterThanLate"
@Tesco I bought this ketchup in September from Tesco Metro in Whitechapel and realise only now that it’s already expired 😠😠😠 https://t.co/9iTXJZ62Gq
"Hi @Tesco , I do love you but how did your new Massaman flavour crisps pass the taste test?! https://t.co/XGzFU9xYav"
@Tesco I had an order last night however not happy with the day in my milk can I exchange these?
@Tesco what do I do if my click and collect still hasn't been delivered to the store. Tracking says it was dispatched Tuesday morning and due for collect yesterday
@Tesco when can I book click and collect for Christmas ?  Thanks
Truly rubbish @Tesco click &amp; collect service at Foots Cray. Waste 90 mins and don't even go home with my order. 😡
"Not only is the @Tesco in Kew an assault course to get around, they now have a security guard glowering at everybody"
"@Tesco what happened to 12 meatballs , I can only see 11 oooops 😳 https://t.co/QwR0nW0L2I"
@Tesco disappointing service on an order where part was 'lost in transit' suggest you train your staff in complaints handling and not suggesting alternatives where the customer will be out of pocket. Disappointing service
@Tesco I'm having problems using my Clubcard vouchers online. It's saying they are unavailable when they are valid
@Tesco what is happening with your updated website second week of completing my weekly shop took 2 hours last week and it looks like it will take longer . Who tested your updates ! Come on Tesco’s spend money on this now otherwise you will not have any shoppers !!
"@Tesco literally went to collect my order, in my mums name (different surname) and I couldn’t pick it up due to not having the same name 🙄"
@Tesco Any idea when your website is going to be working properly to book food delivery slots? It's all very well having a swanky new design when the important bit - i.e. actually ordering food - has been down for more than a week. 🤨
@Tesco Hi.  I raised an order yesterday online (4NX4TH3TC) &amp; system said any time after 3pm Thurs 9 Nov.  Still not available for collection. How are you going to help me? Thanks.
"Hello @Tesco please can you tell your drivers to park both safely and legally? Regular occurrence, around here. https://t.co/Hn6ly72JRm"
Just a thought..@Tesco Maybe it would make sense to remove this item from your site  🤔 #onlineshopping #nolongersold #stockcontrol #website https://t.co/tfv2BTVTFC
@Tesco why can’t I book a delivery slot for Monday 27 November?

"@Tesco Taylor’s album is out today (10th November) when will it be in store, now? Or sometime later today...?"
@Tesco can you tell me why you've raised prices of your chocolate brownie milk by 25%!!! Not happy 😡😤☹️
"@Tesco I am hopelessly addicted to these. Just 2 things though; you need to offer them in a bigger size, and what's with this ""Limited Edition"" nonsense!? https://t.co/aCzTSKGq93"
@Tesco imagine driving far to go get an album after getting this DM and them telling you you can’t have it. Can’t be arsed. Shocking customer service. 😊 https://t.co/eh9cxc33az

"@Tesco I've twice asked you to tell me how I can identify halal-certified products, specifically meats, in your store; what symbol to look out for. Why will you not advise me? I spend £150 per week in your store. Will move to co-op if you don't reply to this"
@Tesco your label fitter actually made my nan phone me at 2am to ask if she was getting dementia cause she couldn't open this juice. https://t.co/gxa8DwOv1j
@Tesco hi x I’ve not had all my items delivered today x I’m a regular delivery shopper n my Tesco help person isn’t answering her phone. ?
@Tesco really sorry a funeral delayed your home delivery driver. Great of them to start beeping and getting Annoyed. Hopefully they never lose a loved one. Respect goes a long way!
@Tesco Hiya! Is there any chance that the Watford store will be releasing #reputation at midnight? Thank you! ☺️
Forgot to take a carrier bag to @Tesco but found one on the floor by the dvds #epicwin 👍😀👊
"This is ridiculous, @sainsburys @Morrisons @117249 @117250 @Tesco @AldiUK @117246  this is the worst practice from abroad  we don't want to see this in the UK or anywhere else. #PlasticFreeCoastlines #plasticwaste #plasticfreeaisle #pointlessplastic https://t.co/W96mn2owM6"
@Tesco got a surprise in my wrap today... nearly broke my tooth on this! Health and safety hazard!!! #notanicelunch #tescomealdeal https://t.co/G74N21zKZL
Great way to clearly label your products @Tesco ... even better that I realise at 7am with no other bread on the house 😠😠 https://t.co/ByHRYpzaZP
@Tesco this is probably the ripest bunch of bananas you had in store yesterday.. how am I meant to eat these? I like a couple bananas a day. Your fruit isn’t great at the best of times.. but this is taking the royal p*ss. Supply riper fruit please.. 👎🍌 https://t.co/LpX57Ty4ze
@Tesco hello will you get anymore mama bear pjs in? Or do you have any instores close to b69 postcode? Thanks
@Tesco think I am going to start using @117249 instead now as it’s cheaper and the products are not damaged nor near by date!
@Tesco Can you confirm if your Telford Extra store has any copies of Call of Duty:WW2 on Xbox please?
@Tesco Why is your milk now in litres? And why is it the same price as 2 pints. I witnessed my friend get upset and confused at this in your store today. Why have you done this? https://t.co/qcFtCDyNAw
@Tesco are these king prawns? Really https://t.co/LHo0b9uNCi

Got 6 tesco donuts for a euro and they’re literally the most bland thing i’ve ever eaten i’m distraught yet still.... eating them
Ordered a signed copy of @139295 book from @Tesco and it turns up not signed :(
Is @sainsburys price matching @Tesco on the new call of duty WW2?
"I feel sad that any new product releases from the supermarkets seem to take a month to reach here 'up north'. I want to try the new dairy free cheeses, @Tesco, &amp; can't find Crispbakes in @sainsburys. Arghhh!"
"Hi @Tesco, your updated self service kiosk screens are very hard to read. The contrast is terrible. Plz remeber #accessibility in your design before you make changes. You do have #partiallysighted customers. Thx"
@Tesco Feeling a little hard done by with only half the samosas I was promised. I think somebody at #Tesco needs a simple maths lesson. https://t.co/BRrjF8oxMF
@Tesco - your kids meals in the cafe are a disgrace. £3 for chicken nuggets and chips is good but you only give three tiny nuggets.  Seriously? Company policy apparently... https://t.co/muwpcpX2ZL
Have @Tesco started testing on animals? All of the products I used to buy no longer have their against animal testing on the back???
Booked my Christmas delivery slot @Tesco Now to start choosing the feast!
"@Tesco hi so in my local Tesco's this morning in the entrance they had Pringles with a big 99p sign. So bought a tube, got home &amp; ive been charged £1.12! Not even the normal price &amp; certainly not the advertised price!"
@Tesco can’t book xmas delivery slots. Are they available?
"I quite often get the 2 dine for £10 from @Tesco to myself, and more often than not eat it all .. to myself .. I’m ok with that 🙂"
Have to recommend @Tesco Lamb casserole kit #RestaurantQuality https://t.co/DyyVunJG4f
@Tesco I cant seem to see how to book my Christmas slot and there really isnt alot of options
@Tesco so first our raspberry jam donuts are actually cherry and then one has this amount of jam in it! https://t.co/B9Fzc1R9qy
@Tesco The cost of 4 pints of milk has miraculous shot up by 10%. How is that a justifiable increase?
"@Tesco I hope you can confirm this is fake news. I won't be shopping at Tesco, and nor will my family, unless you confirm this is not true:
https://t.co/PheQqY2Nze"
"@Tesco is there an issue with 'Checkout' for online shopping. 3 days running, neither hubby nor I can checkout our shop on phones! Slot booked for today but can't pay. #Tesco #Help"
@Tesco Scan as you shop made slight boob today - charged me for 4 packs of your flossers but only said 3 on the display. I heard it beep 4 times but assumed it was someone else's
@Tesco I normally go to bed around ten so last night was a tall order. I was determined to get a good Christmas slot so midnight was the aim. Nodded off 11.15 and woke 00.18. Mad dash for the website! Very pleased I did though. It would have been too late by breakfast. V happy.
@Tesco Please explain https://t.co/iQmeSIU0Hc
@Tesco why have your shelves been this empty all week in food to go? I need lunch and all that’s left is fatty meaty sandwiches and the pasta that clearly nobody buys #livid https://t.co/mHSgDc4iHb

"This, @Tesco, is disgusting. Can you provide assurance that this appalling practice will cease immediately?

(Yes, I'm a regular Tesco shopper... but that could easily change if you keep treating staff as badly as this.) https://t.co/LnmcqLYYt3"
@Tesco Why is it your Express store in Kew Gardens doesn't sell low cost paracetamol?  Just because it's a well-off area doesn't mean you should deny choice and value.  @353948 https://t.co/bfNNF0V5hy
@Tesco is Pokémon ultra sun for the 3ds going to be available for pre-order again soon? Gutted that it's unavailable right now

4 weeks ago I bought a bin from @Tesco and they delivered a trivet. Returned this and they delivered another trivet. Returned this 2 weeks ago and heard nothing. Emailed to find out what's happening and now they tell me the bin has been discontinued. Hopeless customer service.
Absolute madness in @Tesco today! https://t.co/OQ0Z5Dd2hw
If you want an efficient &amp; reliable delivery provider who has any kind of common sense - do not use @Tesco

Oh no @Tesco what am I going to eat! https://t.co/O5rTqd2G30

@Tesco disgusted at the news you will be paying your festive staff via prepaid cards mainly used for teenage pocket money. This costs staff to take money out and transfers to pay bills. Shame on you! I will be boycotting your stores from now on and will be encouraging everyone 2
Green and Black 395g box @Tesco Dundee Kingsway  £11 price on shelf and not £5.50 as advertised! At checkout they are £5.50 so confusing for consumers and happens a lot with many items.

Second time that I bought a pizza in @Tesco and second time its expiration date is from October. My fault because I didn't look before buy but what a joke is this? Remove from the shelves on time.

Also yo @Tesco and @142383 @117249  why the heck can't I find any of your own brand coco pops in store???? They're my purpose for getting up in the mornings 😭😭
@Tesco your website is abysmal. Tried to change my account details but nearly every link went to an error or 404. Just going to shop with @142383 tonight I think.
Thank you @Tesco Bromley-by-Bow for allowing @771357 pupils to trial their business ideas outside the store today. We’re started off this year’s charity collecting with a bang https://t.co/sYzIQs3aPS

@Tesco massively disappointed with my home delivery. Food such as cakes etc has arrived squashed and then meat products have been chucked in the same bag as fabric softener so again squashed. Seriously getting put off Tesco’s.
@Tesco i tried to purchase using your 3 for 2 but the offer isnt coming off.🤔
@Tesco  how could you discontinue your lemon and lime zero? It's far superior to the more expensive 7upfree and Sprite Zero. #heartbroken
@Tesco thanks for giving me a voucher for 10p off per litre of petrol with my home delivery last night. Though you might have saved me a trip out to Tescos this evening for petrol if the driver had pointed out the voucher ran out a hour after I received it.
@Tesco delivered 10 mins ago but dated yesterday? https://t.co/sniXCvCuGY
@Tesco Tell your delivery drivers to keep the noise down. There's a bloke across the mode making a stupid amount of noise. It's late.
@Tesco why does your groceries website crash and hang all the time? A simpler website would be so much more stable!

@Tesco who told you that autofill in the search bar which fills in by default so that you have to delete the wrong guess was a good idea? No other website uses such feature - for a reason. Renders new website unusable and flickering autofilling text is actually giving me anxiety.
"@Tesco Oh yeah, guys. Why did my shopping arrive 15 minutes before my time slot last time I made an order, and items where changed without been called a substitute?"
@Tesco would you be upset if someone walked in your gorton store and followed one of your staff about filming them calling them robbing cunts 🤷‍♂️ just asking

"@Tesco hey guys, out of curiosity, when you place a same day order, how come the price changes? Spoken to your phone team, what said the offer must have expired..... slightly confused how it can expire between placing the order and receiving the goods, 6 hours later #help"

@Tesco every week there is a problem with ur site when doing my order! So now i have lost my slot for tomorrow &amp; cant get one until Thursday-quite frankly a nightmare when I have a newborn baby 😡
When you see an offer advertised for @Tesco and go into your local branch to be told that it may just be certain stores that have the offer is a poor excuse. Plus no signage with the price on the product. Very poor store standards
"@Tesco followed a lorry with your logo on, this evening down the A34. Driver was going up to 70mph and swerving into different lanes in the dark. Came close to another vehicle. Dangerous so I followed rather than overtook. I have number plate."
@Tesco Any idea why every bloody day you flash up on my phone when the nearest shop is miles away?
@Tesco any stores in Glasgow that have the big sleeve edition stand? Really want to get a few.
@Tesco I think you should get single packets of pickled onion monster munch for the meal deals get rid of them quavers

"Love that my @Tesco delivery driver asked for my mum cos there was alcohol in the order. Said “you wouldn’t believe I was 19 would you?” Hahaha he was so shocked, he thought I was 15😂😂😭😩"
Thanks @Tesco - pitch up tonight with the online order without any toilet roll - and apparently can’t find a replacement?! Really? In the whole store there’s no replacement product for toilet roll?! Can @sainsburys or @117249 do any better?
